    	<h2>Bio:</h2>
    	<div class="indent">
    		<p>I am originally from Cincinnai, Ohio but I currently reside in Indiana while attending Purdue University. One of my hobbies is environmental conservation. I am involved in the sustainability club at Purdue and I enjoy doing everything I can to help the planet. Another one of my main interests includes programming. I decided to make this website to further improve my programming skills outside of class and I plan to do more of that with future projects. I will update this website periodically with updates on my projects and my hobbies. I do plan to become an intellectual property attorney, hopefully in the technology industry so I can maintain working with my passion for programming.</p>

    	<h2>This Website!</h2>
    	<div class="indent">
    		<p><em>Fall 2019</em></p>
    		<p>This website was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript programming. These skills were self-taught through online resources as well as prior course-work in other languages.</p>

    	<h2>Multiple assignments in course based on C</h2>
    	<div class="indent">
    		<p><em>Fall 2019</em></p>
    		<p>In my advanced programming in C course, I completed assignments in C such as as making a Sudoku solver, a maze solver, building and working with binary trees, building a basic calculator, etc. However, these are not on my public github due to the restrictions of the course.</p>

    	<h2>MATLAB algorithm for quality analysis of thermocouples</h2>
    	<div class="indent">
    		<p><em>Spring 2019</em></p>
    		<p>I worked closely in a team of four students in a freshman engineering course. We created multiple functions in MATLAB in order to analyze large sets of data to acquire four seperate parameters. These parameters are then used to generate a calibration plot and error in order to determine how well the parameters fit the data for the thermocouples.</p>
