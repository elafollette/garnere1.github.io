    	<h2>This Website!</h2>
    	<div class="indent">
    		<p><em>Fall 2019</em></p>
    		<p>This website was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript programming. These skills were self-taught through online resources as well as prior course-work in other languages.</p>

        <div class="indent">
            <p><em>Fall 2020</em></p>
            <p>In this course, I built circuits as well as programmed in assembly with differnet microprocessor systems. In the end, I was able to build a game using the buttons, timer, and sound feature on the circuit board.</p>

    	<h2>Multiple assignments in course based on C and Python</h2>
    	<div class="indent">
    		<p><em>Fall 2019</em></p>
    		<p>In my advanced programming in C course, I completed assignments in C such as as making a Sudoku solver, a maze solver, building and working with binary trees, building a basic calculator, etc. My python course focused on data analysis. However, these are not on my public github due to the restrictions of the course.</p>

    	<h2>MATLAB algorithm for quality analysis of thermocouples</h2>
    	<div class="indent">
    		<p><em>Spring 2019</em></p>
    		<p>I worked closely in a team of four students in a freshman engineering course. We created multiple functions in MATLAB in order to analyze large sets of data to acquire four seperate parameters. These parameters are then used to generate a calibration plot and error in order to determine how well the parameters fit the data for the thermocouples.</p>
